* model_assumptions_and_scenarios: This folder contains json files containing the relevant asssumptions for infrastructure planning and rate development.
* models: This folder contains the parent models (json files) used in building the systems model.
* results: This folder is currently empty, but we could add some sample results (not household-level results though).
